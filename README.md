# Dog-Vision
An end-to-end multi-class dog breed classification model using transfer learning & tensorflow hub. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.
For preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x. The whole premise here is to get our data into Tensors (arrays of numbers which can be run on GPUs) and then allow a machine learning model to find patterns between them.
